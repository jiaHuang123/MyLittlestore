\block{Introduction}{
  San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on 
  the inescapable island of Alcatraz. Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than 
  its criminal past. From Sunset to SOMA, and Marina to Excelsior, this project analyzes 12
   years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods to create a model 
   that predicts the category of crime that occurred, given time and location.
  
  	\begin{description}
    \item[The Dataset]  is in a tabular form and includes chronological, geographical and
     text data and contains incidents derived from the SFPD Crime Incident Reporting system.
  	
    \item[Data Visualization] is the main method designed in this project. 
    Through data visualization, the data set we will present will finally be visualized and
     the understanding of the data will be more direct.
  
  	\end{description}

    The main task of this project is to make a prediction of the type, time and place of crime
     in San Francisco. In this article, we will give an overview of the whole project from data 
     sets, eigenvalues, feature item selection, modeling and conclusion.

  The dataset contains 2,323 duplicates that are meaningless

    \item[Dates \& Day of the week]
    These variables are distributed uniformly between 1/1/2003 
    to 5/13/2015 (and Monday to Sunday) and split between the training 
    and the testing dataset as mentioned before. We did not notice any 
    anomalies on these variables.
    The median frequency of incidents is 389 per day with a standard deviation
     of 48.51.
     \\
    \item [Per Week]
    Also, there is no significant deviation of incidents frequency throughout 
    the week. Thus we do not expect this variable to play a significant role 
    in the prediction.

\begin{description}
  \item [Category]
    There are 39 discrete categories that the police department file the 
    incidents with the most common being Larceny/Theft (19.91\%), Non/Criminal
     (10.50\%), and Assault(8.77\%).
     \\
  \item [Police District]
  There are significant differences between the different districts of the 
  City with the Southern district having the most incidents (17.87\%) 
  followed by Mission (13.67\%) and Northern (12.00\%).
  \\
  \item [X - Longitude Y - Latitude]We have tested that the coordinates 
    belong inside the boundaries of the city. Although longitude does not 
    contain any outliers, latitude includes some 90o values which correspond 
    to the North Pole.
    \\
    \item [Address]as a text field, requires advanced techniques to use it for 
    the prediction. Instead in this project, we will use it to extract if the 
    incident has happened on the road or in a building block.

{
  Based on the Projectâ€™s statement, we need to predict the probability
   of each type of crime based on time and location. That being said, 
   we present two diagrams to visualize the importance of these variables. 
   The first one presents the geographic density of 9 random crime
    categories. We can see that although the epicenter of most of the 
    crimes resides on the northeast of the city, each crime has a different 
    density on the rest of the city. This fact is a reliable indication
     that the location ( coordinates / Police District) will be a significant
      factor for the analysis and the forecasting.
\vspace{.5cm}

\vspace{.2cm}
\begin{description}
    \item
    The diagram presents the average number of incidents per
     hour for five of the crimes' categories. 
    It is evident that different crimes have different frequency 
    during different times of the day. Some examples are that 
    prostitution picks during the evening and all through the night, Gambling incidents start late at night until the morning and Burglary picks early in the morning until the afternoon. As before these are sharp pieces of evidence that the time parameters will have a significant role also.

  \item[Problem Definition]
  To examine the specific problem, we will apply a full Data Science life cycle composed of the six steps.
  \\
  In this paper, we did not complete the design of this project in 
  strict accordance with the whole journey, but through the 
  main data visualization, we understand and analyze the data set provided visually, which is a great progress.
